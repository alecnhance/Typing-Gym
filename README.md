Typing Gym is a bodybuilding themed typing application designed to give the user control over their typing practice with features such as custimizaeble character frequencies, diverse
capitilization options, and multiple color themes. 

To run this application, JavaFX 11 must be downloaded. Once it is, compile the Type file with the command 
  javac --module-path xxx --add-modules=javafx.controls Type.java
with the path of the JavaFX lib folder replacing the "xxx" in the command. The application can then be run with the command
  java --module-path xxx --add-modules=javafx.controls Type
with the path of the lib folder replacing the "xxx" once more.
